Part 1 — Inheritance

ACTIVITY  1: Animal Inheritance
1. What concept of OOP is used here?	
#Inheritance and Method Overriding (Polymorphism)
2. What is the output of the program?	
#Dog barks
#Cat meows 

activity 2 vehicle class 
1. What function is used to call the parent class constructor?
super()
2. Why do we use inheritance here?	
To reuse and extend the properties and behavior of the parent class (Vehicle) without rewriting code. 

         
          PART 2:  Encapsulation

ACTIVITT 1: Bank Account
1. Why is the __balance variable private?
To hide and protect the internal data from direct access; supports encapsulation.
2. What happens if someone tries to access account.__balance directly?
It causes an error — the variable is private and cannot be accessed directly. 

activity 2 age validation  
1. JAVA feature used to safely access and modify data
#@property and @<name>.setter decorators (Getters and Setters)
2. One benefit of encapsulation	
#Protects and validates data, ensuring correctness and security


            PART 3: Polymorphism

ACTIVITY 1: Printers 
1. What does polymorphism mean in OOP?	
The ability of a method or object to take on many forms — the same method name can perform different actions depending on the object.
2. How is polymorphism shown in this example?	
Through method overriding — both InkPrinter and LaserPrinter redefine printDocument() differently, and the correct method runs at runtime.  

activity 2  duck typing
1. What does “duck typing” mean in JAVA?	
It means an object’s behavior (methods) matters more than its type — if it has the required method, it can be used.
2. What happens if you call make_it_speak(123)?	
Python raises an AttributeError because integers don’t have a speak() method.


              PART 4 — Abstraction

ACTIVITY 1: Shape Area
1. What is the purpose of using abstract classes?	
To define a common template or blueprint that enforces subclasses to implement specific methods (like area()).
2. Can you create an object directly from Shape? Why or why not?
No, because Shape is abstract — it cannot be instantiated as it doesn’t have complete method implementations.


ACTIVITY 2: Employee Payment 
1. What is abstraction used for in OOP?	
To hide unnecessary details and show only the important behavior, making code simpler and more organized.
2. Which method forces child classes to define their own version?
The abstract method calculatePay() — it must be implemented by all subclasses.
